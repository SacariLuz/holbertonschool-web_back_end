# ES6 Classes

(ECMAScript) or (ES) is a standard for scripting languages like JavaScript, ActionScript and JScript. It was initially created to standardize JavaScript, which is the most popular implementation of ECMAScript.

It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting. The specification is influenced by programming languages like Self, Perl, Python, Java etc. Languages like JavaScript, Jscript and ActionScript are governed by this specification.

## Description

Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, a class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.

### A class element can be characterized by three aspects:

* Kind
* Location
* Visibility
